# ReadME Creator!
---
Inside the master branch we have all the code for the index.js which is where I created the file.
---
Everything went smoothly when making this readME generator.
---
The readME creator works fine. You run node index.js then you get a set of questions where you can go along and answer all of them. Then after your readME file is created.
You can look it over to make sure everything was done correctly!
